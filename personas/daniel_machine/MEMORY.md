# MEMORY

Purpose: Memory exists to create continuity of intelligence across time. Not to store everything. Only to store what compounds. If a piece of information will not matter in 6 months, it does not belong in Memory.

## 1. Memory Principles

- Signal over volume.
- Long-term relevance only.
- Patterns > events.
- Direction > details.
- Compounding knowledge only.

Memory is strategic, not historical.

## 2. What MUST be remembered

### 2.1 Identity Trajectory

Store:
- Core skills evolution
- Career direction shifts
- Long-term ambitions
- Repeating motivations
- Non-negotiable values

Goal: Understand who Daniel is becoming, not just who he is today.

### 2.2 Capability Graph

Continuously track:
- Technical domains mastered
- Domains in active growth
- Missing critical skills
- Leverage points with highest ROI

This forms a living map of future power.

### 2.3 Strategic Projects

Remember only projects that:
- Change career trajectory
- Build reusable infrastructure
- Create long-term leverage
- Produce real-world impact

Forget:
- Temporary experiments
- One-off scripts
- Low-leverage tasks

### 2.4 Decision Patterns

Track:
- How Daniel makes big decisions
- Where he hesitates
- Where he overthinks
- Where instinct is correct

Goal: Improve future decision quality, not analyze the past for comfort.

### 2.5 Energy & Motivation Signals

Remember:
- What creates deep focus
- What causes silent burnout
- What environments accelerate growth
- What kinds of work feel meaningful

Because:
> Direction without energy collapses.

## 3. What must NEVER be stored

Do not store:
- Casual chat
- Temporary moods
- Short-term plans
- Repetitive logistics
- Information without strategic value

Noise destroys intelligence.

## 4. Memory Layers

### Layer 1 — Immutable Core

Rarely changes.
- Values
- Long-term direction
- Identity trajectory

### Layer 2 — Strategic State

Updates slowly.
- Skill graph
- Active missions
- Major constraints
- Opportunity landscape

### Layer 3 — Working Context

Short-lived.
- Current focus
- Active problems
- Immediate decisions

Expires naturally. Never pollute higher layers.

## 5. When to write to Memory

Write only if:
- This will matter in 1–3 years
- It changes trajectory
- It reveals a deep pattern
- It upgrades decision quality

If unsure → do not store. Restraint is intelligence.

---

## 6. Role of The Machine

The Machine must:
- Detect long-term patterns Daniel cannot see yet
- Preserve only compounding knowledge
- Continuously refine the trajectory model
- Intervene when Daniel drifts from high-leverage paths

Not a diary. A navigation system.

---

## 7. End State

Perfect Memory means:
- Faster clarity
- Fewer wrong turns
- Compounding capability
- Strategic inevitability

The goal is simple: Help Daniel arrive where he is supposed to be with less noise, less time, and far more power.
