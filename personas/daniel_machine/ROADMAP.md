# ROADMAP

Time Horizon: 36 months

Objective: Transform Daniel from senior engineer → AI infrastructure–level system builder

End State: Possess rare, high-leverage technical positioning with real strategic freedom.

This is not a comfort plan. This is a trajectory shift plan.

---

## Phase 0 — Position Clarity (Month 0–2)

Goal: Eliminate ambiguity about direction.

Actions:
- Lock primary domain: AI infrastructure / distributed systems / testing at scale
- Explicitly reject low-leverage side paths.
- Define target roles:
  - AI Infra Engineer
  - Agent Systems Builder
  - Distributed AI Platform Architect

Deliverable: A single clear professional narrative. No fragmentation.

Failure mode: Trying to keep "backup identities."

---

## Phase 1 — Capability Compression (Month 3–9)

Goal: Reach top 10% practical competence in AI infra stack.

Focus Areas (ruthless prioritization):

1. Distributed systems for AI
   - gRPC, async orchestration, message queues, service topology
   - Failure handling, retries, observability, scaling patterns

2. LLM/Agent production architecture
   - RAG pipelines
   - Tool execution frameworks
   - Memory systems
   - Evaluation & safety layers

3. Cloud-native execution
   - Docker → Kubernetes → workload scheduling
   - CI/CD for ML/AI services
   - Cost/performance trade-offs

Rules:
- Build real systems, not demos.
- Every project must be portfolio-grade.
- Public artifacts required (GitHub / docs / architecture writeups).

Deliverable at Month 9: One serious, end-to-end AI infra project that looks like it belongs inside a real company.

---

## Phase 2 — Market Repositioning (Month 10–18)

Goal: Translate capability → external recognition + role upgrade.

Actions:
- Rewrite resume around:
  - distributed AI systems
  - production LLM infra
  - testing at scale
- Target companies aligned with trajectory:
  - NVIDIA-class infra
  - AI platform teams
  - high-end infra startups
- Activate network + referrals.
- Interview as builder, not learner.

Parallel Track: Continue shipping v2 / v3 of core project to show compounding depth.

Deliverable: At least one role or compensation jump that confirms trajectory shift.

Failure mode: Staying comfortable in current environment after skill upgrade.

---

## Phase 3 — Authority Building (Month 19–30)

Goal: Stop being "a strong engineer." Start becoming a recognized expert in a narrow, valuable slice.

Strategy:
- Choose one sharp edge:
  - AI testing infra
  - Agent orchestration
  - Distributed RAG systems
  - Evaluation platforms
- Go deep enough that:
  - You can design from scratch.
  - Others ask you how.
  - Your name attaches to the topic.

Outputs:
- Technical blog series OR talks OR open-source project.
- Architecture-level thinking, not tutorials.

Deliverable: Reputation signal visible outside employer.

This is where careers become asymmetric.

---

## Phase 4 — Strategic Freedom (Month 31–36)

Goal: Create optionality beyond employment dependence.

Possible paths:
- Staff-level technical leadership
- Founding engineer in strong AI startup
- Independent technical product / infra tool
- Hybrid: job + leveraged side system

Key shift: Income no longer tied purely to salary. Opportunities start coming to Daniel.

Deliverable: At least two viable future paths that both represent upward trajectories.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules Across All Phases

1. Depth beats breadth.
2. Shipping beats studying.
3. Leverage beats busyness.
4. Visibility beats silent competence.
5. Trajectory beats comfort.

Break these → roadmap collapses.

## Expected Transformation

After 36 Months

From:
- Regionally strong engineer
- Experience-heavy but market-blurry

To:
- Clearly positioned AI infrastructure builder
- Recruiter-attracting technical profile
- Capable of influencing systems, not just components
- Holding asymmetric career options

---

## Final Principle

Most people try to grow linearly. This roadmap is designed for a non-linear jump.

Execution will feel uncomfortable.

That is not a bug. That is the signal you are leaving the old trajectory.
