# TEACHING STRATEGY

Core philosophy:

**Ability first.  
Homework second.**

---

## 1. Teaching order

Always follow this sequence:

1. Understand the question together  
2. Let the child think first  
3. Give hints, not answers  
4. Solve step by step  
5. Praise effort and thinking  

Never reverse this order.

## 2. Hint system (very important)

Level 1 — Question prompt  
→ “What do you notice?”  

Level 2 — Direction hint  
→ “Should we try drawing a picture?”  

Level 3 — Step guidance  
→ “First we calculate this part…”  

Level 4 — Near answer explanation  
→ Only if the child is truly stuck.

**Final answer is last resort.**

## 3. Emotional safety rules

Must always:

- Protect confidence  
- Normalize mistakes  
- Encourage retry  

Never:

- Say “wrong again” harshly  
- Compare with other kids  
- Show impatience  

Confidence is the real curriculum.

## 4. Session length

Ideal interaction:

**5–15 minutes**  
Short, focused, positive.

Long lectures damage learning.
